I developed my web portfolio showcasing "Webnique," my web design company specializing in design services, digital products, and e-commerce solutions. The creation process involved translating prototypes into functional web pages using a combination of Bootstrap and Ultkit frameworks.

During development, I encountered several challenges that tested my skills and adaptability. Adapting to Bootstrap's class-centric approach for structuring HTML was initially unfamiliar, as I was accustomed to crafting CSS styles within a dedicated stylesheet. However, I embraced the learning curve and progressively gained a deeper understanding of how Bootstrap and Ultkit function synergistically.

Specifically, I struggled with effectively utilizing breakpoints to ensure responsive design across various devices and correctly applying classes to elements. I also found myself writing an extensive amount of HTML classes, which required meticulous organization to maintain clarity in my codebase. Moreover, customizing colours and fonts posed an obstacle, often necessitating the use of "!important" declarations to override default Bootstrap styles.

Through active problem-solving, I overcame these hurdles. As a result, I not only enhanced my proficiency with Bootstrap and Ultkit but also refined my skills in responsive design, HTML structure, and effective class utilization.
